Yet another challenging activity that required me to draw from a number of outside sources just to get this far. The app is designed for anyone travelling who needs to know specific weather-related information as quickly as possible. It draws on the APIs made available by https://www.openweathermap.org. 

The User is prompted to enter the city name of her/his choice. After clicking "TAB" and "ENTER", the User is giving the following information:
1. City Name and Country Abbreviation
2. Information on Cloud Cover and Precipitation, with helpful icons
3. Current Temperature
4. Predicted Max and Min Temperatures
5. Humidity
6. Wind Speed
7. Ten buttons utilize a callback function that allows a user to click on the popular cities associated with said buttons to return fast weather data

### Challenges remaining:
1. Implementation of a 5-day forecast for the city in question
2. Search history of cities
3. A "dashboard" that stores past searches
4. Continued difficulty with consistently getting images into the README file
